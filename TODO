Textbook Tasks Remaining
========================
- Switch tools to Ractive
- Figure out smarter JS build step
- Write sample code for functions chapter
  * Something that illustrates using functions to refactor
  * Spellchecker/sanitizer/image update?
- Practice questions and exercises:
  * AJAX
  * Inheritance
  * Forms
  * Objects
  * Conditionals
- Redo/rethink interactives:
  * light bulbs
    - Should demonstrate if/if else/if else if
    - Maybe use a flow chart instead of light bulbs?
    - Do people really have problems with if/else? 
  * loops
  * inheritance
    - show the "shadow" properties that are inherited on an object
    - side-by-side code is probably better than the dot interactive
- Add sidebar icons--helpful tip, resources, history, etc.
- Add dev tools detection
  * window.outerHeight - window.innerHeight > 150
  * doesn't work if the window is undocked
  * is there really a place where this is useful?
  * better scenario: create more interactive sections where the page is mutable based on console ops
  * Let's use Ractive to make the page more reactive
- Switch to a nice set of web fonts
- Add a license for this thing
- Add live animation example
- Show asteroids live
